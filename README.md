# virtual Transcoding Unit
Italtel and Universita' degli studi di Milano, 2014 - 2016


## Installation
Clone the repository and copy the folder into the /vTU path.

vTU relies on libav for running transcoding jobs and must be correctly installed in the target system.
While avconv is already shippped in many Linux distribution or can be installed using the appropriate packge manager, in order to fully exploit the hardware GPU acceleration in the encoding into h.264, h.265 and VP8 formats, it is recommended to download, compile and install from this fork:

https://github.com/Italtel-Unimi/libvpx
the GPU accelerated VP8 encoder (fully compatible with standard libvpx), and

https://github.com/Italtel-Unimi/libav
the libav supporting the modified libvpx.
Follow the instructions on those repositories for compilation and installation.

Also, vTU supports the NVidia hardware h.264 and h.265 NVEnc encoder supplied with many GPU cards.


## Usage
For starting the vTU daemon:
<pre>
/vTU/bin/vTUstart
</pre>

The command stops the vTU, releasing the daemon:
<pre>
/vTU/bin/vTUstop
</pre>
and
<pre>
/vTU/bin/vTUrestart
</pre>
restarts the daemon.

The command:
<pre>
/vTU/bin/vTUstatus
</pre>
returns the status of the vTU daemon and the number of running jobs.


Jobs are started by uploading an appropriate job xml descriptor into the /vTU/vTU/spool folder.
